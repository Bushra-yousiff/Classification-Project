### Question/Problem statement:

- Classifying physical performance based on body measurements, counts of several exercises reps, and personal demographics. 
#### Data Description: 
The dataset is a collection of  performance records collected from Korea Sports Promotion Foundation with 12 attributes:
- Age: performer age (int).
- Gender: F / M (text).
- Height_cm: performer height (float).
- Weight_kg: performer weight(float).
- Body fat_%: performer's body fat percentage (float).
- Diastolic: diastolic blood pressure (float).
- Systolic: systolic  blood pressure (float).
- GripForce: the amount of force (float).
- Sit and bend forward_cm: The distance which the performer can reach bending forward (float).
- Sit-ups counts: the situp counts the performer can do (int).
- Broad jump_cm:  The distance which the performer can jump (float)
- Class: A, B, C, D with A being the best (text).
* Rows: there are 13393 instances each represents a person's information.
### Tools: 
- Programs: Python, Jupyter Notebook.
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn.
- Functions: KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, confusion_matrix.
### MVP: 
The goal of this project is to train several classification models on the chosen dataset to help gyms and personal trainers to classify new customers based on their physical performance.
